I went to [@Adam Turag](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U074FK60HD5)'s (Hackclub Slack) PCB workshop. 
I went from 5:30 AM to 7:00 AM IST on the 18th of August 2024. Out of that time, approx. 1 hour from 6 to 7 AM is documented on the hackclub arcade platform.
This github repository, and the contents of this readme are here to document and explain the arcade session.

The schema file is included inside of this repository, and it carries the pcb schema I worked on with Adam in Kicad.
